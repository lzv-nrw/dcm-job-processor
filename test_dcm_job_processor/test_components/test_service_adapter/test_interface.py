"""
The validation of the implementation of the (extended) `ServiceAdapter`-
interface, i.e. its pre-defined functionality is covered by the
extensive set of tests located in the module `test_import_ies.py`.
Here, the `ImportIEAdapter` is used as a dummy for testing the internal
methods. Therefore, the test-modules for other adapter implementations
are only limited to the adapter-specific implementations.
